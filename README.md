vision", submitted for review in Elsevier Journal.

In this work, We have utilized the publicly available dataset of Automated Essay Scoring that is available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/asap-aes/data). In addition, we have also evaluated our approach on a real-life scenario of an O-Level English subject (Subject code: 1123).

We extend our sincere gratitude to the subject experts, Mrs. Sanam Zaryab (English lecturer in O-Levels) and Mr. Usama Abdul Rehman (English Lecturer, Sukkur IBA University), who generously provided the data from their classes for this research. Their willingness to share their resources and expertise has been invaluable in advancing our understanding of this topic.
